# Library Management System (Work in Progress)

## Project Overview

The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a Java-based software designed to automate and simplify essential library tasks, such as cataloging books, managing user accounts, and tracking the borrowing and returning of books. By digitizing these operations, the LMS aims to increase efficiency, minimize errors, and provide a seamless experience for both librarians and users.

**Note**: This project is currently a **work in progress**, with more features and improvements being actively developed.
